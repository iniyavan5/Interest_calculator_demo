# Interest_calculator_demo
This project is a simple Java-based Interest Calculator that helps calculate both Simple Interest and Compound Interest. It works like a mini banking system where a user can create an account, enter details such as principal amount, rate of interest, and time period, and then choose from different service packages. The Basic package calculates only simple interest, the Premium package provides both simple and annual compound interest, and the Business package allows flexible compounding options like monthly or quarterly. The goal of this project is to demonstrate core Java concepts such as user input, class structures, and mathematical calculations while also showing how financial services like interest computation can be modeled in software.
